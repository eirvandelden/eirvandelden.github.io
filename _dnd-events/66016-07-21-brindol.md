- PC's arrived at Brindol
- Talked with the Archeologist (deep gnome that was previously rescued in the Underdark). She was sent by Deekin to offer support by sending some vehicles, but they are still in need of repair. The Archeologist is revealed to be a Harper, but declined to give any further information after learning the PC’s aren’t Harpers.
- PC’s are trying to defend Brindol by:
    - Coming up with a game plan with the leaders of Brindol; Lord Jarmaath (mayor), lady Verassa Kaal (richest merchant), Captain Lars Ulverth, High Priest Tredora
    - Fixing a tank uncovered by the Archeologist
    - Make a stand by the gate, intentionally letting it fall so they can use the tank to shoot the enemies when they are in the courtyard.
