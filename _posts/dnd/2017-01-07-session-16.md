## I. Skull Gorge Bridge

* 1 Bridge. 4 Watchtowers. 1 Dragon, 1 Hobgoblin Captain, 7 Hobgoblins and 2 Hell Hounds.
* While invisible; Crow and Moras killed two hobgoblin guards , Fairuza sniped a third.
* Crow did an awesome spider-climb-jump on tower from one tower to the other, while Zaldar trick-shot his Fire Bolts towards the reinforcements behind Crow
* Zaldar enclosed the dragon in an ice sphere. Twice.
* Crow used Moras's force beads to kill two Hobgoblin s, 1 Hell Hound and jettison the Hobgoblin Captain into the ravine. ‚ÄúAaaaaahhhh‚Ä¶‚Äù
* All the while, Fairuza was sniping away, covering everyones back.
* (Compleated) Dragons talk like Arnold Scharwarzenegger
* When only one creature remained, the dragon, Fairuza saw her chance. Hold breath, aim and ‚Ä¶ _\<shot through the eye\>_ _\<fall to the ground\>_ _\<fall into ravine\>_
* The camp was looted and many potions were found.

## J. Cinder Hill

* The group traveled to Cinder Hill.
* They saw the army the late Seldra de Tylmarande has built. It numbers into the thousands.
* They went back to Skull Gorge Bridge, awaiting a member of the army to interrogate.
