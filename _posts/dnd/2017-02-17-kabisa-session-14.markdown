Party members of this session: _Hacklor, Bhalrick, Astro_

* PCs found the kitchen and avoided it
* PCs went down the stairs, where they fought some bugbears. While both Bhalrick and Astro were knocked out, Hacklor saved the day
* PCs have found 10 prisoners, but could only release 5. The others need to be released using a key
* One room was found, with the sounds of dwarf being tortured coming out of it.
* Another room was found, where a gnarly Hill Giant with two really big apes are sitting
