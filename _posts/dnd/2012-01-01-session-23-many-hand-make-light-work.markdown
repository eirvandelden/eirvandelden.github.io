*Note: This is a new group of players with new PCs. Emphasised parts are notes for me as DM*

* Agreed to help Sunrise, out of lack of anything better
* _Kylar arranged a date with Madam Maritze, owner of the Gentle Moon Inn_
* Group went into the house of Borgo Gizzebog, found a note about Ostram D'el Fargo
* Scouted the temple with Lilly, distracted the Guard Drakes with a goat
* _Defeated Ostram D'el Fargo, left him alive_
* Group received Goblin Totem Dagger
