## Biography

Zaldar was born around 25 years ago, in a quiet town at the outskirts of Nesmé. His parents were humble farmers. His father Warmund Mensk lived in the farmhouse all his live, it was their family heritage. Warmund never had an exciting life, working hard and trading his stocks in the nearby city of Nesmé. In the city he noticed a woman named Kaila. It was love at first sight. Not soon after their married and had a baby boy they named Zaldar after came 2 more children Zarah, a girl and Bord a boy. Warmund never knew his wife possessed magical powers. She was in fact a sorceress. But she hid this fact in fear of rejection. Because she met a lot of people who feared the raw magical power she could wield. As she feared, one of her children possessed the same magical prowess, Zaldar.

The early years of Zaldar life went by quietly. Around the age of 8 the first signs of his abilities emerged. Which consisted mainly of things catching fire randomly. At first the people didn’t though it was Zaldar’s doing. But as the years gone by, they suspected him more and more. They grew wary of him. And the other children in town shunned him. So he began to feel alone, he became an outsider. He was desperate for some attention form the people in town and from the other children. He started pulling pranks. Which they didn’t appreciate. The other children stated to bully him. On one night when he was 12 years old, he was chased by some kids after he tried to set fire to one’s hair. They chased him into and old farmhouse, when they cornered him all hell broke loose. He was so afraid a giant amount of magical energy bursted form him. Setting fire to the whole house and blowing all the children away. When the fire died down the whole farmhouse was gone and most of the children managed to get out, except for one. The whole town blamed this death on Zalder and it was time he left. Kaila knew this would happen as it happened to her too. So she fled with him and took him to a school to train, so he could constrain his own power. She had made some inquiries, so the school would accept Zaldar.

He trained there for a couple of years, but he grew bored. As it was a wizard school they focused on study and acquiring knowledge though books. Zaldar wanted to train his powers by using them, growing bored on the endless reading of arcane tomes. So he did what he liked best, pulling pranks to kill time. Sneaking through the school messing with other people’s business. He even learn to lockpick. So he could steal stuff from other students rooms and planted the items on other. So he could watch the spectacle unfold. One night he wanted to pull the biggest prank yet, he broke into the office of the headmaster and stole his spellbook, when the headmaster was sleeping. But afterwards he didn’t knew what to do with it, so he burned it. Eventually they found out, which resulted in banning him from the school.

So he had nowhere to go to. They rejected him in his old town everybody in the school was mad at him. So he did what he was doing all his life. But this time he wasn’t just pulling pranks, he started to steal, because he needed to eat too. Using the spells which he learned at school. These weren’t his best days stealing from people through deception and breaking in to steal food. When time passed he felt wrong, he didn’t want to pass the rest of his live in the gutter.

Lukily Tjorven found him. Zaldar saw him one day at the market wearing a colourfull robe and emanating a magical aura. He was preforming for a crowd with a huge array of magical spells. Later the evening he followed him to a tawernand pleaded to him to take him in and train him. Eventually he succeded. The next couple of year Tjorven was like a mentor to him, training him in all the aspects of magic. Finally he managed to control his power fully. Tjorven also taught him about the world, its flaw and ideals. He gave Zaldar a sense of justice and morals.

Feeling grief for his previous actions, he wanted to help people now he controlled his powers. So Tjorven sent him to Neverwinter to join the hero’s academy to redeem himself and gaining more power in the process.
Although he controls his powers now for the first 20 years of his life the magical energies have run rampart through his head. Which left it’s mark, some may say that he is insane. He just thinks he’s different. Having trouble concentrating and sometimes having problems realising the results of his actions. If he thinks people deserve punishment, he will let fate decide if he should act. He will flip a coin to see if they deserve punishment.

Fearing the reaction of people about the fact that he is a sorcerer he is carrying a spellbook to  impose as a wizard.

When Kaila droped Zaldar at the school she gave him a ring, saying “It will help you on your way, when you need it the most”. Zaldar never realised what this meant. He kept the ring and kept it on a chain around his neck. He noticed a magical radiance emanating from the ring, but he never found out what it did. He never told anyone about this.
