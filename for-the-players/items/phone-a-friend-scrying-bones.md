There are three bones carved into people with happy faces and sad faces. All happy faces means yes, all sad faces mean no, anything in between means maybe.

These bones can be used to ask a "yes", "no", or "maybe" question to the fates (DM).

The DM can respond or _choose not to answer_.

Each bone contains one charge. Comes in a set of three.
