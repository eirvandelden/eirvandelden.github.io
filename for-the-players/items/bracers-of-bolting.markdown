These red leather bracers cover almost your entire lower arm and are etched with a yellow lightning bolt. When you reach out for the bracers, you stung by static electricity.

*Requires Attunement* Yes
Your unarmed strikes deal lightning damage. On your turn when you damage a creature with an unarmed strike, you may choose to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of that creature. If you choose to do so you appear to pass through that creature as a bolt of lightning.
