_Wondrous item, rare_

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker. They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it canâ€™t be used again until 7 days have passed.

*Requirement* none
*Berserker's Summoned* 2+2d4 Berserkers

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.
