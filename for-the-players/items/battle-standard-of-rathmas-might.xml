    <text>With the press of a button, this small stick expands to a full 8 feet banner. The flag is a red flag, emblazoned with runes of strength. In the centre is the imagery of a sickle and bone, crossed upon a field of grain, the symbol of Rathma.</text>

     When you plant the battle standard in your space or an adjacent square, it creates a zone in a close burst 5. Whenever you or an ally damage an enemy, that damage is increased by 1. This effect lasts until the end of the encounter or until the battle standard is removed from the ground. Any character in or adjacent to a battle standardâ€™s square can remove it from the ground as a standard action.</text>
