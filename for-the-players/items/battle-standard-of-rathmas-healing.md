With the press of a button, this small stick expands to a full 8 feet banner. The flag is a white flag, emblazoned with runes of healing. In the centre is the imagery of a sickle and bone, crossed upon a field of grain, the symbol of Rathma.

When you plant the battle standard in your space or an adjacent square, it creates a zone of healing energy in a close burst 5. Whenever you or an ally regains hit points from a different source and is in the zone, you and all allies in the zone regain 1 hit point. This effect lasts until the end of the encounter or until the battle standard is removed from the ground. Any character in or adjacent to a battle standardâ€™s square can remove it from the ground as a standard action.
