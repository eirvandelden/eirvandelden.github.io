**Last update** _Use a newly created map_

The world of Deneki is a "Medieval Steampunk" kind of world. Technology is a bit further than most D&D worlds (which are Lord of the Rings-esque).
The inhabitants of Deneki are experimenting with new machineries, powered by steam or magical stones.
They have inventions like guns (which quickly replaced bows), and lamps. And plumbing, because who can live without toilets?

The world of Deneki is a new world, but will contain familiar elements from different sources.

### Dates and Times
A year in Deneki is divided in four seasons: **Spring**, **Summer**, **Autumn** and **Fall**. Each season takes **40 days**, so a full year is 160 days.

Everyone references dates and times in terms of days in the season or the year. So either "next year" or "next season". Some examples are:
  - _the 12th of Summer_
  - _the last day of Spring_
  - _three seasons aga_
  - _Signed on the 23th of Spring, year 62015_

**Note** The 40 days were determined to have some form of seasonal shifting *in game*. 40 days are simply quicker to pass, than the full 91 days we are used to.
